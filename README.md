i really like your use of flex on the body to center the grid, i wish i had thought of that personally it would have made my life much easier, i really like that you made the color of the class itself change instead of taking away or adding a class on button click, i think that was a really cool idea that ill have to take notes from

some things i recommend are using auto for your columns widths as that will prevent your gaps from expanding "repeat(4, auto)", as well i would use a set width for your jeremy image just so that it stays a circle when changing screen width, the only other thing i recommend is in your app.js you used a lot of the same code repeatedly, i talked with isaiah for my own project and he showed me how to shorten that into its own function, i recommend asking him to teach you it when you have the chance as its really neat

overall i think you did an amazing job, i really liked your approach to responsiveness and the way you dedicated the fetch to its own js, keep up the great work
